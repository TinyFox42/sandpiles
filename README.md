Numberphile is an amazing channel.

Right now in development.
Feel free to use if you want, this is mainly on github so that I'm able to point to my github saying "I did that".

End goal is to be able to give it a starting x by y sandpile, and have it give all the piles that can be derived from that, in .csv format.
